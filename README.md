## Motivation

### Background
What motivated your team to spend time on this project? An excellent project idea is satisfying and fun to work on, and fills a gap that may not be easily found in the Rust ecosystem.

## Objective and Key Features
What is the objective of this project? What are the key features to be built in the project to achieve this objective? In other words, what is the idea that the completed project is trying to implement? It would be excellent if the idea has some novelty, but it is also important that it is feasible to be implemented within the timeframe of this course. Novelty is represented by the fact that the project, while small in scale, may be filling a gap in the current Rust ecosystem.

## Tentative Plan
Briefly and concisely, describe how your team plans to achieve the project objective in a matter of weeks, with clear descriptions of responsibilities for each team member in the team. As the duration of the project is quite short, there is no need to include milestones and tentative dates.
